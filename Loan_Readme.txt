# Loan Default Prediction

A bank loan can provide numerous benefits, but it is a risk to both borrower and the lender. The lender runs the risk of lending you the money but not getting fully repaid. And as for borrower’s personal financial health, you can lose money or even your house. This is why lenders employ careful underwriting standards to minimize the risk for both parties.

The analysis of risk in bank loans need understanding what is the meaning of risk. In addition, the number of transactions in banking sector is rapidly growing and huge data volumes are available which represent  the customers behavior and the risks around loan are increased. 

The two most critical questions in the lending industry are: 
How risky is the borrower? 
Given the borrower’s risk, should we lend him/her? 

The goal of this project is to find a model where we can predict whether a loan would be paid off in full or the loan needs to be charged off and possibly go default
